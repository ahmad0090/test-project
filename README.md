# test-project
Demo


-> Clone the project and open in android studio it will take some time for sync after that you can easily run the project

Code Approach:

# MVVM Arch
# Coroutines
# Recycler View
# Retrofit
# Fragments
# Data Binding
# Jitpack Libraries

Note: Navigation architecture not used because i forgot to use the Navigation architecture except that every thing mention approaches will be used in the project
      I have complete grip on Navigation architecture if you want to perfrom some tasks using Navigation architecture then definitely i can easily do that.
